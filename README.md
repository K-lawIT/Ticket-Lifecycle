Once the ticket is created, assign the ticket to a department or user. 
  Tickets have several stages in the lifecycle:
  -Open: The ticket is open and awaiting response.
  -Answered: An agent has responded, and the ticket awaits a follow-up from the user.
  -Resolved/Closed: The issue is resolved, and no further action is required.
  -Overdue: The ticket has exceeded the defined SLA.
  -On-Hold: The ticket is temporarily paused due to pending external factors.

After the ticket has been assigned, the agent will communicate solutions, request more details, or provide updates. If a ticket is unresolved or needs higher expertise, it can be escalated. Often, agents will collaborate. Internal notes and tasks can be assigned to other agents.
